In Leadership 10 we had to read a book called 7 habits of highly effective teens, and the assignment was to write a summary on the entire book.
So down below I have the information broken into all 7 habits and a little information on them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>Habit 1 was be proactive.</u><br>
Outline of chapter. <br>
<br>

Being proactive is a major habit. You have to control and  be responsible for your own life. Proactive people understand that they are responsible for their lifestyle.<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>Habit 2 was begin with the end in mind.</u><br>
Outline of chapter.<br>
<br>

If you didn't lead your own life, someone else would.<br>
You have to set out a plan on how you were going to start and reach your final point.<br>
Successful people don't just live day to day without a clear purpose in mind. They mentally identify and commit themselves to the principles, and purposes that are the most important. 
<br>
<br>
<u>Habit 3 was put first things first </u><br>
Outline of chapter.<br>
<br>

Ordering, and doing the most important things first, is extremely important. <br>
The priority was to keep what is priority always priority. <br>
Everything is organization <br>
<br>
<br>
<u>Habit 4 was think win-win.</u><br>
Outline of chapter.<br>
<br>

Don't worry about losing, or everything going downhill, live life think you will eventually win. <br>
Thinking win-win will boost your confidence significantly.<br>
Do not mistake thinking win win as think selfishly and being better than everyone else. Think in a way that can help every one around you win too. <br>
<br>
<br>
<u>Habit 5 was seek first to understand, then to be understood.</u><br>
Outline of chapter.<br>
<br>

Before you seek to be understood by others around you, you need to understand what they have to say as well. In this chapter you learn that you will not always have the best opinion or idea in the room, you will at times, but only if you work together and understand the ideas of those around you . <br>
<br>
<br>
<u>Habit 6 was synergize.</u><br>
Outline of chapter.<br>
 <br>

To achieve your goal faster, you need to work together as a team to get the job done.<br>
Synergy is making a move out of conflict. You don't use your idea, or the person arguing, but you use a completely new idea!<br>
Teams that work with synergy get lots done fast and efficiently.<br>
Cooperation is key.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<u>Habit 7 was sharpen the saw.</u><br>
Outline of chapter.<br>
<br>

Sharpening the saw is about doing a look over your four basic areas of life (physical, <br>
social, mental, and spiritual.) and tweaking, or renewing what is need to be renewed. It is the habit that contributes the most in using all the other habits.<br>
