<h2>Debrief/ Evaluation: Strathcona 2015</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p><u>Part 1: Positives.</u>
<br>
<br>
I feel people learned a lot from what the instructors taught.<br>
<br>
We had very nice instructors that were good leaders.<br>
<br>
The Bog walk was cool<br>
<br>
The food was pretty good<br>
<br>
In the end the plays that were put on were funny.<br>
<br>
The games we played on the first day were fun.<br>
<br>
The Bog Walk was very interesting and we saw some very cool aspects of wildlife and nature<br>
<br>
There was pretty much the entire premises to play around on.<br>
<br>
Water for showering was sufficient<br>
<br>
No one got in any trouble<br>
<br>
We stayed there in manner, and treated our rooms nice.<br>
 
<br>
<br>
<u>Part 2: Things that need improvement</u>
<br>
<br>
The time we were allowed outside could've been longer.<br>
<br>
It would've been cool if the instructors set up a manhunt in the dark game.

<br>
<br>
<u>Part 3: Evaluation</u>
<br>
<br>
 a): Self Evaluation 
<br>
<br>
First off, I want to start off how I conquered my fear of height on this trip, I was completely against rock climbing the minute I saw the height. I did not want to go up, but since we had incredible instructors, I got over my fear and completed the activity, and now I just want to go back to rock climb. Overall, I did't cause trouble, I led the canoe ride back, and helped set up tarps, cook with Peter, and set up a fire. Behavioural wise, I think I was good because I didn't cause mischief or cause trouble, I took the initiative with Peter to try to make a bridge over a small path of water, so we didn't have to get our feet wet.


<br>
<br>
b): Class Evaluation
<br>
<br>
Group Evaluation: 9.5/10

 

I think everyone had a really good time at Strathcona, learning new things, like rock climbing, and facing your fears while doing so. I think people really enjoyed the adventure to their islands as well, even though rowing can be hard, the effort led to an amazing overnight stay that left everyone with an unforgettable time. We didn't cause any trouble while we were there, so I think we did a really good job showing that we are a nice school. Everyone was in their rooms on time and asleep on time, everyone followed the rules we were given, so that is incredible.

<br>
Like I mention in my Individual Evaluation, I was afraid to rock climb but overcame that fear by doing the activity. <br>

 Leading the canoe ride back, but after a while, I lost feeling in my arms, so it was all fine from there.<br>

One thing that I wonder about, is how the whale bones got in the whale room, and what type of whale it is.
