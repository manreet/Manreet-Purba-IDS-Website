<br>
<br>
<u>Quality or Quantity?</u>
<br>
<br>
I think quality matters more over quantity because, I would rather have a little bit of healthy, nutritious food,rather than a lot of unhealthy, bodily harming food. 
<br>
<br>
<u>What should food be?</u>
<br>
<br>
Food should be nutritious and tasty at the same time, so that people would enjoy eating food that's good for you and at the same time tastes really good.
<br>
<br>
<u>Style of film.</u>
<br>
<br>
The style of the film was more like a documentary, explaining where our food comes from and how.
<br>
<br>
<u>Where does food come from?</u>
<br>
<br>
Food comes from, large factories, slaughterhouses, and farms.
<br>
<br>
<u>Should we care?</u>
<br>
<br>
Yes I think we should really start being concerned about where our food really comes from, and what is put inside it.
<br>
<br>
<u>Where should food come from?</u>
<br>
<br>
Food should only come from farms and companies that don’t use harmful chemicals, so that we don’t have to worry about our physical state.
<br>
<br>
There are 47 thousand different products in a produce store
