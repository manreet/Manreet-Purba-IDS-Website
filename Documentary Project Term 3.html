<u> Documentary Project Term 3</u><br>
</h2>

<p> <b> Documentary Evaluation </b><br>
<br>

<br>
<u><b>1. After viewing your own project objectively, do you believe it has enough background information?</b></u>
<br>
<br>
I think our project does have enough background information, my topic was on school safety, and we did have enough information, I had it viewed by a few others before handing it in, and they said it was fine, we had interviews with the principal, recent event that happened around the school. 
<br>
<br>
 <u><b>2. Is there enough information and detail?</b></u>
<br>
<br>
I think it does have enough information and detail yes, we got kind of lucky, since a break in had just happened, so that was helpful towards our documentary, just not helpful towards the school, at all. My documentary did explain a lot about what we have around the school that can be a safety danger, and we did our best to cover all our points.
<br>
<br>
<u><b>3. Is it interesting?</b></u>
<br>
<br>
Our documentary has been said to be interesting by the people that viewed it, prior to me submitting it, it has actual events that took place and interviews, which keeps the viewers focused and paying attention.
<br>
<br>
<u><b>4. Does it have proper credit given?</b></u>
<br>
<br>
Yes, my documentary does have credit given to the people who participated in it, like Tim McGeer, our principal, and the two other people who helped make my documentary project complete, my group members, Tristan and Ethan
<br>
<br>
<u><b> Documentary Letter Grade: B+?</b></u>
<br>
<br>
<u><b>Personal Contribution Letter Grade: A?</b></u>
<br>
<br>
I took the time to try and set up interviews with out principal, and prior to beginning to video tape, I went around the school alone, to see if there were any areas of the school that might be a safety hazard to students of our school. The areas that I noticed, we included in our documentary and try to include the nitty gritty detail of why we chose it.
