<h1>
English 10
</h1>
<p>
For English 10 were assigned 2 books and a play. <br>
The first book we read was To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee. <br>
This book, in a way teaches the reader lessons about equality and empathy.<br>
After that, we read Othello by William Shakespeare.<br>
It sent a similar message as To Kill a Mockingbird about not making judgements of people without actual reason, and also about racism at that time period.<br>
Lastly, we read and studied Divergent by Veronica Roth. <br>
This was a little bit different than the play and the book before that we read. <br>
The book was more modern, but still gave a look at separation among society and different factions instead of races.<br>
