<h2>
<u> FINAL Self Evaluation for Term 3</u><br>
</h2>

<p> <b> Mark: 90% </b><br>
<br>
<u>Why Do I Deserve This Mark?</u><br>
<br>
 I get my Leadership work done on time.<br>
 <br>
 I don't game in class, I work on stuff needed in Leadership or other classes.<br>
 <br>
 Once I'm finished with my work I look for other work to do, instead of gaming.<br>
 <br>
 Usually if some I sit around needs help with their work or hasn't finished their work, I help them out <br>
 <br>
 I volunteer for work that is needed to be done during class, but haven't volunteered for work needed after school, due to lack of time available.<br>
 <br>
 I don't yell, or distract others in class, I usually mind my own business and pay attention to what's going on in class.<br>
 <br>
 I haven't done anything that I'm not comfortable with. I just do what I see is necessary, mostly because I've never gotten use to being out side of my comfort zone and I regret it.<br>
 <br> 
 If we are given time to work on our homework from other classes, I use the time to do my work and not game or watch videos.<br>
 <br>
 Any work I do for Leadership, I put a lot of thought and work into it.<br>
 <br>
 I've remained a flexible student for the year and have been willing to help out with work during class. <br>
 <br>
 I've kept a good attendance, if late or absent, I always came with a note.<br>
