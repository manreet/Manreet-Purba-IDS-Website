<br>
<u>Self Evaluation</u>
<br>
<br>
7/10
Didn’t give full marks because I wasn’t always on task
I did my job when I was at my booth
I should’ve contributed more during the end of the Tournament
I helped other booths
I assigned tasks to people that didn’t have anything to do
I wasn’t always at my booth
I could’ve done better but failed at doing so.
<br>
<br>
<u>Group Evaluation</u>
<br>
<br>
8/10
Didn’t give full marks because not everyone contributed 100%
Most people were on task 24/7 but there were some that werent
Set up and clean up was very fast
banners were good
helped each other out
Floaters actually helped instead of slacking off
Management could’ve been better</p>
