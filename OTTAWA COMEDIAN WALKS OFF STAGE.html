<u>Questions:</u>
<br>
<br>
<b>1. What are your thoughts: does it surprise you?</b>
<br>
<br>
Yes, it's not funny for a man to be harassing someone trying to do their job. Jen Grant is just a comedian that was there for a gig, and a group of men just decided to trash her night and yell sexual things at her, any woman would've reacted the same way, the fact the men did this surprise me, but what Jen did, no.<br>

<br>
<b>2. Should this be allowed to happen?</b><br>

<br>
No, sexual harassment is never ok, doesn't matter who the person is, you're hurting a person feelings, and making them feel uncomfortable it's never ok and never will be ok, to scream such things at a woman.<br>
<br>
<b>3. Was the punishment for the offenders the right punishment?</b><br>
<br>
No, I feel that the man should have been fired, not suspended, forced to pay a certain amount for the damage he caused, and should be banned from the place the event took place. I feel that the man should be publicly humiliated like Jen Grant was.<br>
