<h1><u> Post-Sec Day Reflection </u></h1>



<h3>
Part 1.<br> What went well
<br>

People helped the vistors as they came in and we had floaters going around that did what they were suppose to do,<br> the class remained on task and when they were done their jobs they helped other groups.<br>
<br>
Part 2.<br> What needs to improve
<br>
People need to stay back and help clean up after the event<br>
People needed to be ready for the event before hand so that we dont rush<br>
<br>
Part 3.<br> Self Eval, Explanation, /10<br>
<br>
8/10<br>
When I was done doing what I was assigned to, I helped other groups.<br>
I remained on task and helped people bring in their bags and boxes.<br>
<br>
Part 4. Class Eval
<br>
9/10<br>
Everyone helped out equally and set up, the only thing was people needed to be reminded to help clean up, <br> 
Other than that, the class did almost perfect!
