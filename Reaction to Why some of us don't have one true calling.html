<h1>Reaction to Why some of us don't have one true calling</h1>



<p>
I feel like I am a multipassionite because I always dive into many hobbies and get interested in many different topics, and decide to become a master in whatever it is, and then after a while, just switch. For example, in grade 8, I wanted to become a neurosurgeon, and I learned everything there was to it for a person my age. Then, in grade 9, I wanted to become a hardware engineer. I wanted to learn how to build circuits and motherboards, so I took up electronics class that year. The next year I dropped the class because I wanted to now become a family physician, and this has been my longest passion because I have been wanting to pursue this dream for the past two years and plan to stick to it. The video was very informative to others that were trying to figure out their passions too. The TedX talks  are very useful to me,  I value them a lot and learn a lot from them.
