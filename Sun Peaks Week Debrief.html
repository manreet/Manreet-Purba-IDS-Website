<br>
<p><u>Part 1: What Went Good</u>
<br>
<br>
We were on time to our lessons.
Practiced a skill in a new sport.
People were always with buddies.
People were careful on the runs.
<br>
<br>
<u>Part 2: Things that need improvement/ tweaking</u>
<br>
<br>
Some could have improved just little bit on our behaviour.
Social room should have been kept open more often
More time to go on the hills.
More activities
<br>
<br>
