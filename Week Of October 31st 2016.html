<h1>Week of October 31th 2016</h1>



<p>
I have learned a lot about the program and I am ready to start working on my project. I still have to come up with what it is that I want to do with my project, but I do have a rough idea. I am thinking of taking a video that I make at home of my self or my family and adding effects in such as moving them around and changing their faces. If not, I might resort to a simple picture edit, whatever I find that I can finish by the deadline
