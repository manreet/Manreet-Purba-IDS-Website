<h1>Week of April 2nd 2017</h1>



<p>
I polished up my main part of the project, I am starting to finalize the entire video. I plan to finish on time, If not, I might resort to a simple picture edit, whatever I find that I can finish by the deadline<br> I am now working towards my finished product. I am finding the project to be very easy. I think I did a good job on picking the right topic</p>
