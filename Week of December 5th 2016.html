<h1>Week of December 5th 2016</h1>



<p>
I've done some touch ups to what I presented for the end of term 1, i'm learning how to use 3D features so that I can make more detailed videos. I am beginning towards my end of the year project, the intro is finished I am polishing up the main parts, and then I will be working on the ending. I am about 45% of the way through with the project.
