<h1>Week of May 15th 2017</h1>



<p>
I went ahead and started working on an outro for my project. I still have a cluster of ideas but I am starting to figure out just how many I can work with and how many I cannot.<br> Still thinking of ideas on how to make it all work out. Won't be easy, but won't be that hard either.</p>
