<h1>Week of May 23rd 2017</h1>



<p>
Found an idea to use for my outro and have started working towards finishing it. Even though I have finalized, I might just go back and decide to change, but I highly doubt it, as my current idea is something I am fond of.<br> Planning on finishing within the week. If not, I might just resort to a picture edit which wont be as hard, but more time consuming within a day.</p>
