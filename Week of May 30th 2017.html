<h1>Week of May 30th 2017</h1>



<p>
Finished my outro, now working towards putting it all together to present. Very proud of my self for finishing. Personally I like it alot but I think I might be more bias towards myself, so I will be looking forward to the fair. <br> Will be finished in time for Fair, which is something I didnt expect, but I did work very hard to get this far with it, and I found that I have learned alot </p>
