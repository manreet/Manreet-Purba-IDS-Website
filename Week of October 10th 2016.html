<h1>Week of October 10th 2016</h1>



<p>
Iâ€™ve still been watching videos on how to do overlays, and edit moving objects. I am still researching what add ons I will need to perform these edits too. So far I have put together a list of about 15 additional items that I will need to download in order to go through with my project. I want to have a rough idea of what I want to make by next week or the week after, and get started on it the week after. I have the program downloaded, and once  I have the add ons, I will begin editing.
